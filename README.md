Date and time is displayed at the top. The calendar button next to the date time is a date picker, selecting a different date will change the date for the page. Time is only displayed if the date the same as current date. The arrows to the left and right of the date/time will move the current selected date up one day or down one day.

User is able to save events to local storage. If events have been saved they will be populated once the page loads. If user deletes an event and clicks save it is removed from the planner and cache.

Planner is color coded, past time sections are grey, current time section is red, and anything in the future is green.
